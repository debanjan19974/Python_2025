# What is Variables?
#a variable is a symbolic name that serves as a reference or pointer to an object in memory. Variables are used to store data,
# which can then be manipulated or used throughout the program. Python variables do not need to be declared with a specific type,
# as Python is dynamically typed. The type of a variable is determined by the value assigned to it.
